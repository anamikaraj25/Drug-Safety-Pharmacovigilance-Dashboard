# Drug-Safety-Pharmacovigilance-Dashboard
Drug Safety &amp; Pharmacovigilance Dashboard  A Drug Safety &amp; Pharmacovigilance Dashboard is a visual analytics tool designed to monitor, analyze, and report adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and drug safety parameters. Based on the provided Power BI dashboard.

KEY  COMPONENTS:-
1.	Age vs Sex Distribution
Purpose: Analyzes the distribution of drug users by gender and age.
•	A bar chart represents the distribution of age across male (M) and female (F) patients.
•	It helps in identifying if a particular gender is more prone to ADRs.
2.	Sodium to Potassium Ratio (Na_to_K) by Drug
Purpose: Evaluates electrolyte balance for different drugs.
•	This metric represents the sum of Sodium to Potassium levels for different drugs.
•	Higher Na_to_K levels can indicate potential electrolyte imbalances due to medication.
3.	Age vs Drug & Sex
     Purpose: Shows drug usage patterns across different demographics.
•	A segmented analysis of different drugs based on the age group and gender.
•	Helps in understanding if a specific drug affects different age groups or genders disproportionately.
4.	Cholesterol by Blood Pressure (BP)
     Purpose: Analyzes the impact of drugs on lipid profiles and cardiovascular risks.
•	A pie chart displaying the percentage of patients with high, low, and normal cholesterol levels based on their blood pressure.
•	Useful for evaluating cardiovascular risks associated with drug use.
5.	Na_to_K by Cholesterol & Drug
   Purpose: Examines drug influence on electrolyte levels in patients with different cholesterol Profile.
•	A comparative analysis of Sodium to Potassium levels across different drugs and cholesterol levels.
•	Helps in identifying which drugs may cause electrolyte imbalances based on cholesterol levels.
6.	Na_to_K by BP & Cholesterol
Purpose: Examines combined effects of BP and cholesterol levels on electrolyte balance.
•	This metric further categorizes Na_to_K levels by both blood pressure and cholesterol.
•	Helps in determining whether high BP or cholesterol affects the electrolyte balance due to drug consumption.
Why Is This Dashboard Important?
1. Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) Detection: Identifies patterns in drug safety and side effects.
2. Personalized Medicine: Supports customized drug prescriptions based on demographics.
3.Regulatory & Compliance Support: Helps in reporting pharmacovigilance data to health authorities.
4. Clinical Decision Support: Assists doctors in making data-driven prescribing decisions.
